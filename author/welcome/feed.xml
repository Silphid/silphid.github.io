	     <p>Hey! Nice to have you here! My name is Mathieu Frenette and I like to call myself a <em>mindful software designer</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, I develop software too, but I like to think of my job mostly as a creative one. Juggling, sculpting and assembling ideas, models and flows. Crafting code meticulously like clockworks.  Not only for computers to digest, but especially for real people to live with, starting with my fellow developers, whose experience will be significantly impacted, for better or for worse, by the choices I make. Just like a building architect, designing a balanced, functional and agreeable space for people to live in. But in this case a <em>virtual space</em>. It’s a great responsibility, but also one of the most rewarding challenges I know.</p>

<p>In this blog, I will share with you some of the most uplifting concepts and techniques I have come across in my last two decades of development. Things I have had the opportunity to learn from others, generous enough to share. Things I have created myself, out of problems, failures and frustration, dreaming of some <em>better way</em>.</p>

<p>It is far from a complete achievement. In fact, it’s only the beginning of the journey. A path I decided to call <em>mindful software design</em>.</p>

<p>On this road, we’ll cover a broad range of topics, from high level concepts, patterns and best practices, to concrete techniques, like API design, fluent syntaxes, reactive extensions (Rx) and dependency injection (DI), using C# and Unity 3D as our playground. I will also pick many examples out of my <a href="/silphid.unity">Silphid.Unity</a> framework, which is abundant in interesting patterns to dissect.</p>

<p>I will be releasing my first post about abstraction very soon, <em>The Chair is Black (or What You Could Do With a Second Brain)</em>, so don’t forget to <a href="#subscribe">subscribe</a> to receive my latest posts as they are published !</p>

<p>Bon voyage! :)<br />
Mathieu</p>
